2022 pilot study on effects of CcBV alone on MS growth - archived jun 2024

VIRUS INJECTION EXPTS 
~Mar 2022-May 2022


# purpose

* testing effects of virus alone. expanding on that “dose dependent Cotesia” paper from Dushay and Beckage.
  * trying to replicate in our own lab colony (bc its diff from D&B’s pop)
  * see if virus alone can generate WOWEs (ie eternally eating huge things)


# details

* 2 main rounds: 1 (4 dosages, inject at 3rd d1), and 2 (repeat 0.10 and 0.01 doses)
* round 3: testing “fresh” vs 1 day post living at 4C virus —> find that this is when i shouldnt be freezing the virus lol
* round 4: adding in heat shock, using 0.5 and 1 we only, added fb extractions
